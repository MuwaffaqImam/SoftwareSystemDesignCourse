/**
 * Suppose we have a Shape hierarchy consisting of different shapes such as Circle, Square, and Triangle.
 * We also have a Color hierarchy consisting of different colors such as Red, Green, and Blue.
 * We want to be able to change the color of a shape dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * Implement the Bridge pattern, then create two separate hierarchies,
 * one for the Shape and one for the Color,
 * and then use composition to bridge the two hierarchies.
